"""
Minimal offline stub of the `genlayer` SDK.

THIS IS A TEST-ONLY SHIM, NOT PART OF THE DEPLOYABLE CONTRACTS.

The real GenLayer SDK (`genlayer` package + GenVM runtime) is only
available inside a GenLayer node / GenLayer Studio / testnet, and
provides trustless, consensus-checked implementations of web access,
LLM calls, the caller's cryptographic identity, cross-contract calls, and
the equivalence-principle voting protocols.

This stub is adapted from the pattern used in the sibling MatchGuard
project's `tests/genlayer_stub/`, with one addition MatchGuard never
needed: MatchGuard is a single contract, so its stub never implements
`gl.get_contract_at(...)`. Vigil is a genuine three-contract system
whose entire mechanism depends on real cross-contract `.view()`/`.emit()`
calls (ClaimVerifier reading ReputationLedger's score and writing a
delta back; DisputePanel correcting ReputationLedger) -- and this is
exactly what genlayer-test's own "Direct Mode" was confirmed, live in
CI, NOT to actually execute (see LESSONS_LEARNED.md). This stub adds a
small in-process contract registry so `get_contract_at(address).view()`
/`.emit()` route to the real target contract instance, synchronously,
letting the whole system's real cross-contract logic run offline in
plain Python.

For fast, fully offline unit testing of Vigil's DETERMINISTIC logic
(tier selection, reputation deltas, authorization checks, wiring), this
stub reproduces just enough of the SDK's surface area to import and
exercise the three contracts directly, with `gl.nondet.web.render` /
`gl.nondet.exec_prompt` monkeypatched per test case and
`gl.message.sender_address` settable per test case to simulate different
callers.

It intentionally does NOT attempt to simulate:
  - real network access,
  - real LLM behavior,
  - multi-validator consensus / leader-validator divergence,
  - `.emit()`'s real asynchronous, separate-transaction timing (this
    stub calls the target method immediately/synchronously, which is
    fine for asserting the eventual state these tests check), or
  - GenVM's real deterministic clock.

Those require the actual GenLayer Studio or testnet -- see the
project's README and LESSONS_LEARNED.md for how the live end-to-end
tests were run there.
